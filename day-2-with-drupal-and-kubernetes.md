Day 2 Kubernetes
================

Success! Kubernetes is up, your site is deployed and the traffic is flowing in. The team high fives and celebrates a successful launch.

This was the teams first Kubernetes project and they had to slay many dragons during the development process, these ranged from low level networking decisions to high level deployment workflows.

It had been a long road, but it's not over...

Those dragons are back! Welcome to Day 2.

This is talk for the Day 2 operators who want to hear war stories about what it's like to run Kubernetes in production for 4 years.

This talk is also for the Day 2 operator who want to know where the Cloud Native community is heading next and how it related to Drupal.
