Secure your development workflow with containerised databases
=============================================================

What would you do if your laptop was stolen?

Have I got your attention?

Think about all the databases that were on that laptop. Think about all the usernames and passwords which where stored in those databases.

Development workflows which require a database are generally perceived as:

* Complex and secure - Lots of controls and processes to access a database.
* Simple and insecure - Direct access to an environment and developers have free rein.

What if I told you we could have database workflows which are both "secure and simple".

Containers aren't just for shipping code, they can also enable simple and secure workflows.

Come to this talk to learn about how containers aren't just changing how we ship code, but also how they are enabling new workflows.
