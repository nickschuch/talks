Drupal 8 and GRPC
=================

Our applications are growing! Gone are the days where we manage the entire application in one monolithic application.

As Drupal developers, we are constantly getting asked to integrate with different types of APIs. One API type which is
building in popularity is GRPC.

GRPC is a combination of technologies which allows for easier integration between client and server, allowing for less
"architecting" of how an API should be structured (I'm looking at your REST) and getting on with the the actual
integration itself!

So how do we write integrations for GRPC APIs? Come to my talk and find out!

## What will you get out of this talk

* Why GRPC?
* An understanding of why we should should integrate with GRPC endpoints
* How you can extend Drupal 8 to talk to GRPC servers
