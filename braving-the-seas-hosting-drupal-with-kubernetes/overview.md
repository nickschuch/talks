Braving the Seas: Hosting Drupal with Kubernetes
================================================

PreviousNext have been hosting Drupal applications on Kubernetes in production for a 1.5 years, over this time we have grown in
operational experience and have the stripes to prove it.

Kubernetes provides developers and operators with so many new frameworks for effectively maintaining uptime for our applications while
at the same time giving us so many new ways to cause outages if misconfigured.

When was the last time you had to consider:

* Am I routing traffic to my containers correctly?
* How am I monitoring the health of my application? eg. Can I write to the filesystem?
* How do I backup this complex infrastructure?

PreviousNext have had these lessons and many more over the coarse of its hosting journey on AWS.

Come to this talk and hear about the continuous improvements PreviousNext had to make to it's hosting infrastructure to get it to where
it is today. 

Come for the talk, stay for the group therapy.
