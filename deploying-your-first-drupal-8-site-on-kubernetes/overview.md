Deploying your first Drupal 8 site on Kubernetes
================================================

Gone are the days where developers need to worry about the infrastructure under the application, now we package our
applications into deployable units called "containers" and ship them off to clusters! That should be the end of it,
but it's a lie!

Kubernetes is an application deployment framework born out of Google, managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
and available on all 3 of the major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure and GCP) as managed services. We now have a standard application
deployment framework for the cloud, developers now have a whole set of new APIs and concepts to learn!

PreviousNext have been hosting Drupal applications on Kubernetes in production for 1.5 years. During this time we have developed
a set of best practices for deploying Drupal 8 to Kubernetes and we want to share those with you!
