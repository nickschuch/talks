Integrating with The Hive: Drupal 8 and GRPC
============================================

With the rise of container based infrastructure, microservice based architectures are on the rise in the enterprise.

Wait! Drupal isn't a microservice! What will we do!?

Don't fear, GRPC is here.

GRPC is a declarative API framework born out of Google, based on their internal system "Stubby RPC". GRPC allows for developers to do less "architecting" of how an API should be structured (I'm looking at you REST) and more time getting on with the the actual business logic. With GRPCs rise in popularity, it's becoming common amongst microservice environments.

Drupal 8 can be the portal into the microservice platform for content editors.
