Restrospective: Hosting Drupal with Kubernetes
==============================================

PreviousNext have been hosting Drupal applications on Kubernetes for a 1.5 years, over this time we have grown in
operational experience and have the stripes to prove it.

Come to this talk and hear about the continuous improvements we had to make to get us to where we are today with running
Drupal on Kubernetes in production. 

Come for the talk, stay for the group therapy.

## What will you get out of this talk

* An understanding of what it takes to host Drupal in production on Kubernetes
* The challenges that others have faced in day-to-day operations
* Therapy. Isn't it fun to get in a room with others and talk about our incidents? :)
